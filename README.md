# Basic-Python

Welcome to the **Basic-Python** repository! 🎉

This repository is focused on learning and exploring the foundational concepts of **Python programming**. It includes various exercises, code examples, and explanations of key Python data structures.

## **EXPLORING PYTHON STRINGS:**

### **WHAT ARE STRINGS IN PYTHON?**

A **string** in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). Strings are **immutable**, meaning once they are created, their contents cannot be changed.

---

### **KEY FEATURES OF PYTHON STRINGS:**

- 🔹 **ORDERED**: Strings maintain the order of characters, meaning you can access them by index.
  
- 🔸 **IMMUTABLE**: You cannot modify the string after it's created, but you can create a new string based on modifications.
  
- 🔹 **SUPPORTS VARIOUS OPERATIONS**: Strings support operations like slicing, concatenation, and formatting.

---

### **PURPOSE OF STRINGS:**

Strings are primarily used for **working with textual data**. Since they are immutable, strings are more memory-efficient, and their contents can be safely shared across multiple parts of a program.

---

## **EXPLORING PYTHON LISTS:**

### **WHAT ARE LISTS IN PYTHON?**

A **list** in Python is an ordered collection of items enclosed in square brackets (`[ ]`). Lists are **mutable**, meaning you can change their contents after they are created.

---

### **KEY FEATURES OF PYTHON LISTS:**

- 🔹 **ORDERED**: Lists maintain the order of elements, meaning you can access them by index.
  
- 🔸 **MUTABLE**: You can modify the elements of a list after it's created, including adding, removing, or changing elements.
  
- 🔹 **SUPPORTS VARIOUS OPERATIONS**: Lists support operations like indexing, slicing, concatenation, and iteration.

---

### **PURPOSE OF LISTS:**

Lists are primarily used for storing and working with **collections of data**. Since they are mutable, you can modify them dynamically, making them ideal for scenarios where the data might change during execution.

## **EXPLORING PYTHON TUPLES:**

### **WHAT ARE TUPLES IN PYTHON?**

A **tuple** in Python is an ordered collection of items enclosed in parentheses (`( )`). Unlike lists, tuples are **immutable**, meaning once created, their contents cannot be modified.

---

### **KEY FEATURES OF PYTHON TUPLES:**

- 🔹 **ORDERED**: Tuples maintain the order of elements, meaning you can access them by index.
  
- 🔸 **IMMUTABLE**: You cannot modify the elements of a tuple after it's created. This includes adding, removing, or changing elements.
  
- 🔹 **SUPPORTS VARIOUS OPERATIONS**: Tuples support operations like indexing, slicing, concatenation, and iteration, but they do not support item assignment or modification.

---

### **PURPOSE OF TUPLES:**

Tuples are primarily used for storing **immutable collections of data**. Since they are immutable, they are often used in situations where you need to ensure the data cannot be changed. Tuples are also useful for creating keys in dictionaries or ensuring data integrity across different parts of a program.
