Exploring Python Strings: A Key Data Structure!

In Python, strings are one of the primary data structures. Today, let's dive into strings and understand how they work in Python.

What are Strings in Python?

A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single quotes (') or double quotes ("). Strings are immutable, meaning once they are created, their contents cannot be changed.

Key Features of Python Strings:

Ordered: Strings maintain the order of characters, meaning you can access them by index.

Immutable: You cannot modify the string after it is created, but you can create a new string based on modifications.

Supports Various Operations: Strings in Python support various operations like slicing, concatenation, and formatting.

Purpose of Strings:

Strings are primarily used for working with textual data. Since they are immutable, strings are more memory-efficient, and their contents can be safely shared across multiple parts of a program.

Repository Contents:

Code examples demonstrating how to create and manipulate strings.

Practical exercises for understanding string operations, including concatenation, slicing, and formatting.

A Jupyter notebook with additional exercises for hands-on learning.
