# Basic-Python

Welcome to the **Basic-Python** repository! 🎉

This repository focuses on learning foundational concepts of **Python programming**, including exercises, code examples, and explanations of key Python data structures. These are:

1. **Strings**
2. **Lists**
3. **Tuples**
4. **Sets**
5. **Dictionaries**

---

## **EXPLORING PYTHON STRINGS:**

### **WHAT ARE STRINGS IN PYTHON?**

A **string** in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in single (`'`) or double quotes (`"`). Strings are **immutable**, meaning their contents cannot be changed after creation.

---

### **KEY FEATURES OF PYTHON STRINGS:**

- 🔹 **ORDERED**: Strings maintain the order of characters, accessed by index.
- 🔸 **IMMUTABLE**: Cannot modify a string once created.
- 🔹 **SUPPORTS OPERATIONS**: Operations like slicing, concatenation, and formatting are supported.

---

### **PURPOSE OF STRINGS:**

Strings are used for **working with textual data**, offering memory efficiency and safe sharing across program components.

---

## **EXPLORING PYTHON LISTS:**

### **WHAT ARE LISTS IN PYTHON?**

A **list** in Python is an ordered collection of items enclosed in square brackets (`[ ]`). Lists are **mutable**, meaning you can change their contents.

---

### **KEY FEATURES OF PYTHON LISTS:**

- 🔹 **ORDERED**: Lists maintain the order of elements.
- 🔸 **MUTABLE**: You can modify elements by adding, removing, or changing them.
- 🔹 **SUPPORTS OPERATIONS**: Supports indexing, slicing, concatenation, and iteration.

---

### **PURPOSE OF LISTS:**

Lists store and manipulate **collections of data**, making them ideal for dynamic data.

---

## **EXPLORING PYTHON TUPLES:**

### **WHAT ARE TUPLES IN PYTHON?**

A **tuple** in Python is an ordered collection of items enclosed in parentheses (`( )`). Tuples are **immutable**, meaning their contents cannot be modified.

---

### **KEY FEATURES OF PYTHON TUPLES:**

- 🔹 **ORDERED**: Tuples maintain the order of elements.
- 🔸 **IMMUTABLE**: You cannot modify tuple elements.
- 🔹 **SUPPORTS OPERATIONS**: Operations like indexing, slicing, and concatenation are supported.

---

### **PURPOSE OF TUPLES:**

Tuples store **immutable data**, ensuring integrity, and are often used as dictionary keys or constant values.

---

## **EXPLORING PYTHON SETS:**

### **WHAT ARE SETS IN PYTHON?**

A **set** in Python is an unordered collection of unique items enclosed in curly braces (`{ }`). Sets do not maintain any specific order and do not allow duplicates.

---

### **KEY FEATURES OF PYTHON SETS:**

- 🔹 **UNORDERED**: No guarantee of order; items are not indexed.
- 🔸 **UNIQUE**: Unique items are allowed.
- 🔹 **MUTABLE**: You can add or remove items, but not modify elements.
- 🔸 **SUPPORTS OPERATIONS**: Supports operations like union, intersection, and difference.

---

### **PURPOSE OF SETS:**

Sets store **unique collections of data**, helpful in eliminating duplicates and performing set operations like union and intersection.

---

## **EXPLORING PYTHON DICTIONARIES:**

### **WHAT ARE DICTIONARIES IN PYTHON?**

A **dictionary** in Python is an unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces (`{ }`). Each key in a dictionary is unique.

---

### **KEY FEATURES OF PYTHON DICTIONARIES:**

- 🔹 **UNORDERED**: No guarantee of the order of key-value pairs.
- 🔸 **KEY-UNIQUE**: Keys must be unique, but values can be duplicated.
- 🔹 **MUTABLE**: You can modify, add, or remove key-value pairs.
- 🔸 **SUPPORTS OPERATIONS**: Supports operations like adding, updating, and deleting key-value pairs.

---

### **PURPOSE OF DICTIONARIES:**

Dictionaries store **key-value pairs**, making them ideal for mapping and fast lookups.

---
