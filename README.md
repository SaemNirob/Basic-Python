Exploring Python Strings: A Key Data Structure!
What are Strings in Python?

A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single quotes (') or double quotes ("). Strings are immutable, meaning once they are created, their contents cannot be changed.

Key Features of Python Strings:

Ordered: Strings maintain the order of characters, meaning you can access them by index.

Immutable: You cannot modify the string after it's created, but you can create a new string based on modifications.

Supports Various Operations: Strings support operations like slicing, concatenation, and formatting.

Purpose of Strings:

Strings are primarily used for working with textual data. Since they are immutable, strings are more memory-efficient, and their contents can be safely shared across multiple parts of a program.

Exploring Python Lists: A Key Data Structure!
What are Lists in Python?

A list in Python is an ordered collection of items enclosed in square brackets ([ ]). Lists are mutable, meaning you can change their contents after they are created.

Key Features of Python Lists:

Ordered: Lists maintain the order of elements, meaning you can access them by index.

Mutable: You can modify the elements of a list after it's created, including adding, removing, or changing elements.

Supports Various Operations: Lists support operations like indexing, slicing, concatenation, and iteration.

Purpose of Lists:

Lists are primarily used for storing and working with collections of data. Since they are mutable, you can modify them dynamically, making them ideal for scenarios where the data might change during execution.
